# Lung-Cancer-Prediction

This project aims to predict lung cancer risk using machine learning techniques, leveraging a dataset with 26 variables and 1000 patient records. The goal is to identify high-risk individuals for targeted screening programs, potentially influencing public health policy.

## Project Overview
Lung cancer remains one of the most deadly forms of cancer, with early detection being crucial for improving survival rates. This project focuses on developing predictive models that can classify patients into different risk categories, enabling more effective and timely medical interventions.

## Dataset
- Size: 1000 patient records
- Variables: 26 features including demographic information, lifestyle factors, and medical history
- Target: Risk of lung cancer (High/Medium/Low)

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing
- Normalization: Standardizing numerical variables to improve model performance.
- Categorical Encoding: Transforming categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
- Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to lung cancer risk.

## Modeling
Implemented various machine learning algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
Each model was trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate and reliable approach for predicting lung cancer risk.

## Model Evaluation
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated models using ROC curves, confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved a high accuracy in predicting lung cancer risk, making it a potentially valuable tool for early detection and targeted screening.
- Detailed findings and model interpretations are available in the comprehensive project report and presentation.

## Deliverables
- Report: A 3000-word document detailing the methodologies, results, and implications of the study.
- Presentation: A 24-slide presentation summarizing key findings and their potential impact on public health.
- Source Code: R scripts for data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
